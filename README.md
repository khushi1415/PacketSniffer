# PacketSniffer
Packet Sniffing or Network Traffic Analysis is the process of tracking all incoming and outcoming traffic, network traffic, and availability using packet sniffers. Packet sniffers are used for comparing real-time networks and past data for detecting anomalies and potential vulnerabilities.
A Python 3 Network Packet Sniffer was developed. As packets arrive at a certain network interface controller, it disassembles them and displays the information on the screen.
